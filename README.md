# Employee Attrition Factors Analysis
'Employee Attrition' is currently one of the most pressing concerns organizations face in terms of human resource management. Employee attrition occurs when employees leave the organization voluntarily or retire, resulting in an unexpected downsizing of the company. Considering employees are the organization's backbone, the company's performance is greatly influenced by the employee's quality. Employee attrition has serious consequences for the company's growth and workforce since training new employees is costly in terms of both money and time, and it results in the loss of experienced personnel, which has a negative influence on productivity and profit.

### Questions of Interest

Organizations can avoid employee attrition by monitoring and regulating the factors that trigger it. This project assists in determining the factors that contribute to employee attrition in a company. The scope of this project, answers the following questions that could help restrain employee attrition:  
- Which department has the highest level of employee attrition?  
- What are the key parameters that HR needs to monitor to prevent employee attrition?  
- Can a pattern be observed amongst key parameters to identify the likelihood for employee attrition?

The outcomes of this study can equip HR teams to make appropriate adjustments in the company's policies ahead of time, decreasing the uncertainty associated with attrition to a certain extent. This project identifies the most common causes of employee attrition intended to facilitate HR departments in taking proactive measures to improve employee retention

### Findings

To sum it up, the core motive of this project is to help the HR team in curbing employee attrition using data-driven insights. Initially, an exploratory analysis was done to understand the data better and to extract the features that are strongly correlated to the attrition.

Using Gradient Boosting Classifier, the features that contributed highly to the attrition were abstracted. However, the accuracy of the model was not good enough (86.68%).  To augment the accuracy and to make better predictions about attrition, the SVM model was created. It improved the test prediction accuracy to 88.58% and the model was able to predict the attrition. 

Using the learnings from the project, the HR team will be better positioned in taking proactive decisions to reduce financial, organizational, and other risks caused due to unexpected employee attrition.
